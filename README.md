Project Overview âš¡âš¡âš¡:
This is an app that helps you put down things urgently in a To-do list app.

Problem statement ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²:
Build an app that helps people keep track of their activities for the day.

I built this with:
THis project is primarily a React project, built on CodeSandBox.

Other external dependencies include:
CSS

Google Fonts

Learning curve ðŸ› ðŸ› :
With this project, I really got to undrstnd React states very well, having used state multiple times in my project.

I also got to really understand the spread operator, and the concept of destructuring very well.

Had to get around to using the map method for arrays, and also conditional rendering to help with the strike-through effect!.

Just realised that I haven't ever really bothered to change the faveicons for any of my react apps. Opps! ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª

## Issues encountered:
As at the tme of writing this, i haven't fully figured out how to manipuulate local storage with React. It seems a rather complicated thing. I will be giving it another shot later.
